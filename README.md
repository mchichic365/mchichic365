**Solutions Architect → DevOps Engineer** | AWS | Kubernetes | Infrastructure as Code

I build secure, portable cloud platforms for mission-critical environments. My background spans cloud architecture, intelligence operations, and enterprise systems — I bring the same discipline to infrastructure that I learned supporting national security missions.

## What I Build

**Cloud-native platforms** designed to run anywhere. Kubernetes over managed containers. Terraform over CloudFormation. ArgoCD over CodePipeline. Every decision optimized for portability — because contracts change, but good architecture transfers.

**Current focus:** EKS platform engineering, CI/CD pipeline automation, and migrating legacy workloads to Kubernetes with DoD security patterns baked in from day one.

## Projects
